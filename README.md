# CODE-JAVA-Multithread
Mutli Thread Core Java Program

This program creates a shared list and multiple threads to add and remove elements from the list. The AddThread and RemoveThread classes implement the Runnable interface and use synchronization to ensure that only one thread modifies the list at a time. The main method starts the threads and waits for them to finish before printing the final state of the shared list.
